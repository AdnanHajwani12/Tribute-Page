                <h2>Life and Legacy</h2>
                <p>
                    Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, known as 'Mahatma' or 'Great Soul', was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India. A prominent leader of the Indian independence movement, Gandhi championed the cause against British colonial rule through his philosophy of nonviolent civil disobedience. His leadership and vision led to India's independence and inspired global movements for civil rights and freedom.

                    Gandhi's approach to activism emphasized 'ahimsa' (nonviolence) and 'satyagraha' (truth and firmness). Beyond political liberation, he advocated for social reforms including the abolition of the caste system, the promotion of women's rights, and the alleviation of poverty. His simplistic lifestyle, often marked by his traditional attire of a dhoti and shawl, underscored his commitment to self-sufficiency and humility.

                    His major campaigns, such as the Salt March and the Quit India Movement, were pivotal in mobilizing the masses and challenging oppressive structures. Tragically, Gandhi's life was cut short when he was assassinated on January 30, 1948, but his legacy of peaceful resistance and universal brotherhood endures.
